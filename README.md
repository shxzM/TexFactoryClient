# TexFactoryClient
App made to see worker's performance throughout the week. The data comes from Admin app and this app converts it into graphs

This is the opening page of the app. Here you can select the day of which you want to see the data. Whichever day you select, it will show you the data of that day in a graph as well as the data of previous 6 days in a different graph.

Here, you can see the name of the worker and their status for the day. If they were inactive for any hour, the graph would dip to 0 at that hour and raise to 1 if active.

If you click a worker's name, you will be directed to this page. The above graph shows their weekly performance. The graph follows a point system. 8 hours for 6 days means 48 hours which means 48 points.
If for any hour, the worker has made more than 3 defects. he will not get the point for that hour. That is why the graph is not a straight line. 
The below graph shows their defects per hour for that day.
